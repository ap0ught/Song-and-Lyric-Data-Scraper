Use this file to set up a scraping session. When a line begins with '##', the following line will be a command for that parameter.

When writing commands, you must copy LITERALLY from the options given, meaning case-sensitivity and spacing is important. Comma separation if multiple parameters are used.

There are commands filled in by default to give you a sense of what things should look like and to give you the ability to do a dry run with no user-specified params.
